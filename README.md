# Gumroad License Validation Library for Google Apps Script

This library exists with a pretty singular focus, namely helping people who are making add-ons or other products with Google Apps Script monetize their solutions using Gumroad licensing.

The library itself has a few helpful methods for actual validating the license code, showing default UI prompts to activate a license, storing the license details in the properties for the script, user, or document, and invaldating the license.
