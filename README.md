[![clasp](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-clasp-4285f4.svg)](https://github.com/google/clasp)

This library exists with a pretty singular focus, namely helping people who are making add-ons or other products with Google Apps Script monetize their solutions using Gumroad licensing.

The library itself has a few helpful methods for actual validating the license code, showing default UI prompts to activate a license, storing the license details in the properties for the script, user, or document, and invaldating the license.

## Getting Started

All of the library methods are statically available on the `GumroadLicenseValidator` class
